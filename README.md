# Introduction
This is my first web development project, following the amazing curriculum provided by The Odin Project.
In this project, I have built a basic recipe website from scratch.
The website consists of a main index page, with links to various recipes.

# Contents
The website consists of a landing page that contains links to three pages. These pages contain descriptions, ingredients, and steps for three recipes: lasagna, Vietnamese fresh spring rolls, and Irish stew.
