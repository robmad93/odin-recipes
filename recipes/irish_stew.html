    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Irish stew is made with lamb. Every Irish household has its own recipe for this famous dish. I like to add chunky pieces of parsnip for a little sweetness and fresh rosemary for a distinct flavor and aroma. Fantastic on St. Patrick's Day served with a pint of the black stuff, of course!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 pounds boneless lamb shoulder, cut into 1 ½ inch pieces</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt, plus more to to taste</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
        <li>2 carrots, peeled and cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>1 parsnip, peeled and cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>4 cups water, or as needed</li>
        <li>3 large potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1 cup coarsely chopped leeks</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add lamb pieces and cook, stirring gently, until evenly browned. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Stir in onion, carrots, and parsnips and cook gently for a few minutes. Stir in water. Cover and bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer until lamb is tender, about 45 to 1 hour, depending on the cut of meat you used.</li>
        <li>Stir in potatoes, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, before adding leeks and rosemary. Continue to simmer uncovered, until potatoes are tender but still whole.</li>
        <li>Serve piping hot in bowls garnished with fresh parsley.</li>
